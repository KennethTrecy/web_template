# Web Template
This is a web template repository of Kenneth Trecy Tobias. Its purpose is to be used for other
templates/projects either by forking this repository, copying its files, or merging its history to
other existing templates/projects.

This template has multiple branches that are named after the main package(s) they contain. For
example, [`rollup` branch] contains [`rollup` package]. If there multiple packages in a branch
features, they are concatenated using `-` character. By default, they contain [`jest` package] as
the default testing framework.

The only exceptions are the `empty_package_json` (contains no package) and `unit_test` (contains [`jest`
package] and it is a parent branch of most other branches).
